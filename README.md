## Goals

### Year of Commits

This year I am embarking on a personal challenge to commits at least five time a week, regardless of the complexity and size of it.  The goal is to do it often and regularly to learn.  **Family comes first and it has been difficult to spend time working on my personal project, so my commits are down.  It is a journey not a destination.**

### My homelab

My homelab has been a project going on for over a decades emerging from a single Synology device to a full blown cluster system.  My goal is to learn architecture, infrastructure as code and deploy all services on a Kubernetes cluster managed via GitOps.
